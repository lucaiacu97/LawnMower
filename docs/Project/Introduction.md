# **Autonomous Mower Project Documentation**

## **üìñ Introduction**

### **üîç Overview**

Maintaining a lawn is a repetitive and time-consuming task, especially in large gardens with numerous obstacles.  
Manually maneuvering around these elements requires constant attention, making the process both physically demanding and inefficient.

This project proposes a **fully autonomous lawn mowing system** capable of navigating complex layouts, adapting its path around obstacles, and maintaining a consistent cutting pattern ‚Äî all while minimizing user involvement.

By integrating **smart scheduling**, **adaptive obstacle handling**, and **customizable mowing zones**, the system ensures an effortlessly well-maintained lawn and a significant improvement in convenience and precision.

### **üß± General Structure**

The system is composed of three interdependent components:

#### **Mower**

The autonomous core unit responsible for cutting the grass.  
It navigates the lawn using an array of sensors for obstacle detection and full area coverage, while transmitting telemetry data.  
Its primary focus is on **real-time decisions**, leaving **long-term planning** to the Station.

#### **Station**

A centralized hub that functions both as a **charging base** and a **high-bandwidth data-processing center**.  
The Station handles computationally intensive tasks, system diagnostics, and manages communication. It also supports firmware updates and data syncing.

#### **User Interface**

A mobile app that allows remote control, scheduling, monitoring, and performance analysis.  
It provides real-time feedback (battery status, task progress, etc.), lets users set preferences, and sends alerts for maintenance or issues.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Operational Principles**

Once the garden has been mapped, the system functions as a coordinated unit:

1. The mower is activated via a **predefined schedule** or **user command**.
2. The Station computes the optimal strategy for the selected mowing area.
3. The mower executes the cutting task, handling real-time navigation and dynamic obstacles.
4. Regular position updates are exchanged between mower and station.
5. At the end of the job ‚Äî or when the battery runs low ‚Äî the mower **returns to the Station**, where:

- Data is uploaded to the mobile app.
- The battery is recharged.

#### **Handling Problems**

Two main real-time issues may arise during operation:

1. **Positioning Error Detected**

- The Station halts the mower.
- It recalculates the accurate position and updates the path.
- The mower resumes, ensuring that all grass is covered, including any missed patches.

2. **Unknown Obstacle Detected**

- The mower reports the obstacle.
- The Station verifies the obstacle against the stored map.
- If new, the mower maps its size and location.
- Navigation resumes with an updated path.

### **üéØ Target**

This project is designed for users with **challenging outdoor environments** who want **automated, intelligent, and low-maintenance lawn care**.

#### **Terrain Challenges**

- **Complex layouts**: Navigation around trees, bushes, and temporary obstacles (e.g., furniture).
- **Varied surfaces**: Soft grass, uneven soil, or permeable pavers.
- **Large areas**: Efficient mowing while optimizing battery use and coverage time.
- **Narrow passages**: Precise movement in tight spaces.
- **Steep slopes**: Stability and traction on inclines.
- **Raised areas**: Handling level transitions of over 10 cm.

#### **Smart User Features**

- Dynamic obstacle detection with real-time reporting.
- Self-diagnosis of faults and errors.
- Custom mowing zones through user-defined maps.
- Flexible scheduling via the mobile app.
- Status updates and maintenance alerts.
- Visual progress and history tracking.

### **ü•Ö Objectives**

The primary goal is to build a **cost-effective**, **intelligent**, and **robust** autonomous lawn mower that can operate in real-world environments while remaining affordable and user-friendly.

In addition, this project serves as a **personal challenge** and **professional development opportunity** for the author.  
In traditional industrial settings, automation tasks are divided among multiple departments, limiting holistic experience.  
This project enables deep involvement across the entire development process ‚Äî from design to deployment ‚Äî offering valuable growth in:

- Automation & control systems  
- Project planning & time management  
- Risk assessment & testing methodologies  
- Cross-disciplinary problem solving  

Tackling such a complex system demands a disciplined, structured approach ‚Äî essential skills for leading future advanced engineering projects.
